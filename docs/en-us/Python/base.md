## Write HelloWorld output
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
Since $\forall O\in \mathscr{O}$, $O$ is an open set. Since $\mathscr{U}$ is a countable basis for $X$, by property of basis, $O$ can be written as a countable union of elements of $\mathscr{U}$, $$O= \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} U_n\in \langle \mathscr{U} \rangle_{\sigma}$$
Hence $\mathscr{O} \subseteq \langle \mathscr{U} \rangle_{\sigma}$
By the minimality of $\langle \mathscr{O} \rangle_{\sigma}$, $\langle \mathscr{O} \rangle_{\sigma} \subseteq \langle \mathscr{U} \rangle_{\sigma}$. Namely, if a $\sigma$-algebra $\langle \mathscr{U} \rangle_{\sigma}$ contains another collection $\mathscr{O}$, then it must contain the smallest $\sigma$-algebra generated by $\mathscr{O}$.
